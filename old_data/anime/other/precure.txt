Production The series was first registered by Toei at the Japanese Copyright Office on October , . and although it will still feature battle scenes like its predecessor, Kira Kira will have a different style of fight scenes called Colorful Pop Battles in order to fit with the series's theme.  In an interview with the team behind the series, they expressed a lot of concepts being used and adapted in the series. The producers stated that the -piece team concept was used after  years in order to differentiate it from the previous series, Maho Girls PreCure! which uses the "Buddy Concept". The motif of the series was decided also by the producers due to the choices are being taken. Producer Yu Kaminoki said that "Running a Sweets Shop/bakery is one of many girls have dreamed of when they grow up, and that is a good theme for the next series. However deciding on how fighting elements would fit in a Dessert-themed series is hard and is not compatible with Pretty Cure or any fighting girls series" and also stated "using Animals as a secondary morif could help balance the first motif of the series and is possible with imagination, to actually make the series work than just using Sweets as the series's motif". Also, the producer said that "Animal mofif would extend to the main character, Ichika, who decorates and creates desserts with an animal motif due to her huge imagination."  While discussing the staff, the producer said that Kohei Kureta and Yukio Kaizawa were chosen to direct the series, as a way to lessen the burden in production due to coming up with newer concepts. Yukio Kaizawa was also chosen due to his work with Cure Flora and the Mischievous Mirror short film and that he said that he wanted to incorporate new ideas into the series as director. Kaizawa also stated that it was his first time to direct a series in Toei's Sunday morning lineup since joining the staff and that directing alongside Kohei Kureta would be a challenge. Kureta was grateful that he can work with him. Despite working together, both directors will direct the series in different episodes and both will have responsibility for how the series will turn out.  For the characters, the staff made each of their personalities unique in order to match the animal motif of the series. The most unique one to stand out is Akira, in which the producers based her overall role to the "Otokoyaku  actresses of Takarazuka Revue, a theatrical group owned by Hankyu Corporation. Nanako Mori said that her experience with the group in the past is the inspiration for her role in the anime and that playing a big sister in the series is a first.
