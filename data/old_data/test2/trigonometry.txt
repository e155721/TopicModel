Trigonometry Outline  istory Usage Functions  Generalized trigonometry Reference Identities Exact constants Tables Unit circle Laws and theorems Sines Cosines Tangents Cotangents Pythagorean theorem Calculus Trigonometric substitution Integrals  Derivatives v t e Trigonometry (from Greek trigナ肱on, "triangle" and metron, "measure"  The rd-century astronomers first noted that the lengths of the sides of a right-angle triangle and the angles between those sides have fixed relationships: that is, if at least the length of one side and the value of one angle is known, then all other angles and lengths can be determined algorithmically. These calculations soon came to be defined as the trigonometric functions and today are pervasive in both pure and applied mathematics: fundamental methods of analysis such as the Fourier transform, for example, or the wave equation, use trigonometric functions to understand cyclical phenomena across many applications in fields as diverse as physics, mechanical and electrical engineering, music and acoustics, astronomy, ecology, and biology. Trigonometry is also the foundation of surveying.  Trigonometry is most simply associated with planar right-angle triangles . Trigonometry on surfaces of negative curvature is part of hyperbolic geometry.  Trigonometry basics are often taught in schools, either as a separate course or as a part of a precalculus course.

A thick ring shell at the Indus Valley Civilization site of Lothal, with four slits each in two margins served as a compass to measure angles on plane surfaces or in the horizon in multiples of  degrees, up to  degrees. Such shell instruments were probably invented to measure 窶whole sections of the horizon and sky, explaining the slits on the lower and upper margins. Archaeologists consider this as evidence that the Lothal experts had achieved an – fold division of horizon and sky, as well as an instrument for measuring angles and perhaps the position of stars, and for navigation.  Sumerian astronomers studied angle measure, using a division of circles into  degrees.  In the rd century BC,  ellenistic mathematicians such as Euclid and Archimedes studied the properties of chords and inscribed angles in circles, and they proved theorems that are equivalent to modern trigonometric formulae, although they presented them geometrically rather than algebraically. In  BC,  ipparchus  Centuries passed before more detailed tables were produced, and Ptolemy's treatise remained in use for performing trigonometric calculations in astronomy throughout the next  years in the medieval Byzantine, Islamic, and, later, Western European worlds.  The modern sine convention is first attested in the Surya Siddhanta, and its properties were further documented by the th century  Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata. Trigonometry was still so little known in th-century northern Europe that Nicolaus Copernicus devoted two chapters of De revolutionibus orbium coelestium to explain its basic concepts.  Driven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large geographic areas, trigonometry grew into a major branch of mathematics.  Overview Main article: Trigonometric function  In this right triangle: sin A = a/c; cos A = b/c; tan A = a/b. If one angle of a triangle is  degrees and one of the other angles is known, the third is thereby fixed, because the three angles of any triangle add up to  degrees. The two acute angles therefore add up to  degrees: they are complementary angles. The shape of a triangle is completely determined, except for similarity, by the angles. Once the angles are known, the ratios of the sides are determined, regardless of the overall size of the triangle. If the length of one of the sides is known, the other two are determined. These ratios are given by the following trigonometric functions of the known angle A, where a, b and c refer to the lengths of the sides in the accompanying figure:  Sine function , defined as the ratio of the side opposite the angle to the hypotenuse. \,. Cosine function , defined as the ratio of the adjacent leg to the hypotenuse. \,. Tangent function , defined as the ratio of the opposite leg to the adjacent leg. \,. The hypotenuse is the side opposite to the  degree angle in a right triangle; it is the longest side of the triangle and one of the two sides adjacent to angle A. The adjacent leg is the other side that is adjacent to angle A. The opposite side is the side that is opposite to angle A. The terms perpendicular and base are sometimes used for the opposite and adjacent sides respectively. Many people find it easy to remember what sides of the right triangle are equal to sine, cosine, or tangent, by memorizing the word SO -CA -TOA .  The reciprocals of these functions are named the cosecant , respectively:  , , . The inverse functions are called the arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent, respectively. There are arithmetic relations between these functions, which are known as trigonometric identities. The cosine, cotangent, and cosecant are so named because they are respectively the sine, tangent, and secant of the complementary angle abbreviated to "co-".  With these functions, one can answer virtually all questions about arbitrary triangles by using the law of sines and the law of cosines. These laws can be used to compute the remaining angles and sides of any triangle as soon as two sides and their included angle or two angles and a side or three sides are known. These laws are useful in all branches of geometry, since every polygon may be described as a finite combination of triangles.  Extending the definitions  Fig. a – Sine and cosine of an angle θ defined using the unit circle. The above definitions only apply to angles between  and  degrees . The trigonometric functions are periodic, with a period of  degrees or π radians. That means their values repeat at those intervals. The tangent and cotangent functions also have a shorter period, of  degrees or π radians.  The trigonometric functions can be defined in other ways besides the geometrical definitions above, using tools from calculus and infinite series. With these definitions the trigonometric functions can be defined for complex numbers. The complex exponential function is particularly useful.   See Euler's and De Moivre's formulas.

Mnemonics Main article: Mnemonics in trigonometry A common use of mnemonics is to remember facts and relationships in trigonometry. For example, the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios in a right triangle can be remembered by representing them and their corresponding sides as strings of letters. For instance, a mnemonic is SO -CA -TOA:  Sine = Opposite ÷  ypotenuse Cosine = Adjacent ÷  ypotenuse Tangent = Opposite ÷ Adjacent One way to remember the letters is to sound them out phonetically . Another method is to expand the letters into a sentence, such as "Some Old  ippie Caught Another  ippie Trippin' On Acid".  Calculating trigonometric functions Main article: Trigonometric tables Trigonometric functions were among the earliest uses for mathematical tables. Such tables were incorporated into mathematics textbooks and students were taught to look up values and how to interpolate between the values listed to get higher accuracy. Slide rules had special scales for trigonometric functions.  Today, scientific calculators have buttons for calculating the main trigonometric functions . Most allow a choice of angle measurement methods: degrees, radians, and sometimes gradians. Most computer programming languages provide function libraries that include the trigonometric functions. The floating point unit hardware incorporated into the microprocessor chips used in most personal computers has built-in instructions for calculating trigonometric functions.

Sextants are used to measure the angle of the sun or stars with respect to the horizon. Using trigonometry and a marine chronometer, the position of the ship can be determined from such measurements. Main article: Uses of trigonometry There is an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and trigonometric functions. For instance, the technique of triangulation is used in astronomy to measure the distance to nearby stars, in geography to measure distances between landmarks, and in satellite navigation systems. The sine and cosine functions are fundamental to the theory of periodic functions, such as those that describe sound and light waves.  Fields that use trigonometry or trigonometric functions include astronomy , seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences, land surveying and geodesy, architecture, image compression, phonetics, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography and game development.  Pythagorean identities The following identities are related to the Pythagorean theorem and hold for any value:   \sin^ A + \cos^ A =  \ A\  Angle transformation formulae  \sin  = \sin A \ \cos B \pm \cos A \ \sin B  \cos  = \cos A \ \cos B \mp \sin A \ \sin B   Common formulae   Triangle with sides a,b,c and respectively opposite angles A,B,C Certain equations involving trigonometric functions are true for all angles and are known as trigonometric identities. Some identities equate an expression to a different expression involving the same angles. These are listed in List of trigonometric identities. Triangle identities that relate the sides and angles of a given triangle are listed below.  In the following identities, A, B and C are the angles of a triangle and a, b and c are the lengths of sides of the triangle opposite the respective angles .  Law of sines The law of sines  for an arbitrary triangle states:  , where  \Delta  is the area of the triangle and R is the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle:  . Another law involving sines can be used to calculate the area of a triangle. Given two sides a and b and the angle between the sides C, the area of the triangle is given by half the product of the lengths of two sides and the sine of the angle between the two sides:  ab\sin C. Law of cosines The law of cosines  is an extension of the Pythagorean theorem to arbitrary triangles:   c^=a^+b^-ab\cos C ,\, or equivalently:  .\, The law of cosines may be used to prove  eron's formula, which is another method that may be used to calculate the area of a triangle. This formula states that if a triangle has sides of lengths a, b, and c, and if the semiperimeter is  , then the area of the triangle is:  , where R is the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle.  Law of tangents The law of tangents:   Euler's formula Euler's formula, which states that  = \cos x + i \sin x, produces the following analytical identities for sine, cosine, and tangent in terms of e and the imaginary unit i:  .
