 that looked like a giant Viking longship, to the GF-NO Nether Gundam, which was a giant windmill, among many others.  These designs worked in the context of G Gundam because the series wasn窶冲 trying to convince the viewer that these were realistic machines. They were exaggerated caricatures of mecha and were knowingly goofy and therefore fun.   This is why when Endless Waltz came along, one of its major mecha designs was and still is jarringly awful.  The premise of Endless Waltz has the true meaning of Operation Meteor revealed; with colony drops on the Earth as a prelude to invasion and conquering the planet. Part of this original plan was enacted in the TV series, as the five Gundams were dropped onto Earth but the colony drops were omitted, as they would be an overly devastating strategy to take.  Thankfully, the former Gundam pilots return to save the day, bar one initially, and thwart the true Operation Meteor once and for all.  The returning Gundams also get a major makeover and redesign, with each of them looking considerably more potent than their TV-related counterparts.  However, it is worth clarifying here that the mecha in Gundam Wing are intended to be believable machines and not the goofy caricatures as in G Gundam. That said, the excessive melodrama from the Gundam Wing TV series resulted in some very strange design choices when it came to Endless Waltz.  The good news is that mecha like the OZ-MSB Tallgeese III are fantastically done and really show off Hajime Katoki窶冱 talents but it窶冱 when you get to the Gundams that things start to go a bit wrong.  To start with, the XXXG-D Gundam Deathscythe Hell looks like a bat but that窶冱 not too far from what it looks like in the TV series, just a bit more exaggerated. The real issue here though is when the XXXG-W Wing Gundam Zero surfaces.  ツゥ SOTSU 窶「 SUNRISE 'Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz' is now out on Blu-ray.  For fans of Gundam, you will know that there is a general angel wing design motif that often recurs with some of the Gundam designs. Mecha like the RX--ホス Hi-Nu Gundam, with the fin funnels arranged at the rear in a wing-like configuration, are a good example of this.  In the case of the updated Wing Zero Custom, the design motif is far less subtle and the results make one of the main mecha in Endless Waltz look like some kind of giant mecha chicken.  These aren窶冲 stylized mechanical wings, they have feathers. It窶冱 just bizarre and entirely out of context of not only the setting of the TV series but also this OVA as well. Naturally, this updated version of the Wing Zero Custom is explained somewhat within the anime but it still looks very out of place and makes what would be a dramatic story unintentionally ridiculous.  I will be honest here, I was never the biggest fan of the original Gundam Wing TV series to begin with. So having Endless Waltz up the ante in terms of melodrama is not something I was really going to enjoy and the mecha designs, especially the Wing Zero Custom, just emphasize that further.  Like the TV series though, Sunrise didn窶冲 hold back on the production of Endless Waltz. This is one of the best-looking mecha anime from the heyday of 窶冱 Japanese animation. So to have it widely available on Blu-ray definitely does this series justice in terms of the animation expertise on show.  That said, this is not an anime I personally enjoy.  As for this Blu-ray release, Right Stuf Anime continue to do excellent work, as the visual and audio quality is very well done. The English dub and subtitles are also competent and don窶冲 detract from the visuals.  What is unlike other Right Stuf Anime releases though is that this Endless Waltz set has some fantastic extras.  From the original Endless Waltz OVA and movie edition, you also have the never before released Operation Meteor!. You also get the various clean opening and ending animations.  So if you are already a fan of Gundam Wing, then you should pick up this set if only for the Operation Meteor! release but if giant mecha chickens and excessive melodrama aren't your thing, then you may want to give this one a miss.  Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz is now available on both Blu-ray and DVD from Right Stuf Anime.
