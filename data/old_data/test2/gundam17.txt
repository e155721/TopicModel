 child soldiers that make up the ranks of a civilian security company called Chryse Guard Security. Tasked with escorting a Martian noblewoman called Kudelia Aina Bernstein to Earth, the Earth military force of Gjallarhorn has other ideas.   Attacking the Chryse Guard Security base, the child soldiers are overpowered by the Gjallarhorn mobile suits until a relic of the Calamity War surfaces, the mobile suit Gundam Barbatos piloted by Mikazuki Augus.  What follows is a story about a plucky band of rebels trying to complete their mission and overthrow tyrannical Earth rule.  The first season of Iron-Blooded Orphans is interesting for all sorts of reasons but not least in how it handles the child soldiers and the mecha their pilot. In that, in order to control these complex machines, they use something called the Alaya-Vijnana System, which is a cybernetic interface across the spine that directly connects to the mecha they pilot.  Children are used as the cybernetic interface is a dangerous one to make and most adults would not survive the process. This creates an army of child soldiers that are remarkably adept at handling complex machinery but are a cheap and expendable workforce from a business standpoint.  Unlike a typical Gundam series, the mecha also do not have beam weaponry for the most part and the combat is up close, brutal and gritty in its depiction.  The series is also very nicely animated for the most part, with the talents of Masami Obari being noteworthy throughout.

However, while the world building and overall setting are very well done this doesn’t feel like it needed to be a Gundam show.  In fact, Iron-Blooded Orphans has far more in common with the work of Ryosuke Takahashi than Yoshiyuki Tomino, with Fang of the Sun Dougram being very notable here.  Admittedly, we have already gone down this path partly before, with Gundam  taking several major elements out of Blue Comet SPT Layzner, yet another Takahashi series, but here the only thing that is really Gundam is some of the styling for the Gundam Barbatos.  This is not to say that Iron-Blooded Orphans is not an interesting series but I think it could have benefitted more in a creative sense by having it be its own thing, without having to work within the of a Gundam series.  Written by Mari Okada, Iron-Blooded Orphans is a well-executed series and the characterization is deftly done, with the brotherly bond between Mikazuki and Orga making up the backbone of the series. As Mikazuki increasingly puts himself in harm’s way, with the strain of piloting the Barbatos slowly killing him.  The first season is also well paced in terms of its story, as it is clear what the objective is for these child soldiers to achieve and Gjallarhorn being obviously something that needs to be overcome.  As for this Blu-ray release, the audio and picture quality are excellent. The English dub is also decent but again I still prefer the original Japanese dialogue, with the English subtitles being good as well. In terms of extras, bar some trailers, there is not much else to speak of.  When it comes to the Limited Edition boxset though, which this review is based off, you also get a small artbook, as well as a metallic gloss finish / scale Gundam Barbatos kit. There is also extra room in the series box for the second season, once those sets are released.  Overall, this is a solid first season collection for a good modern mecha series. However, it would have benefited going its own way rather than having to work within the confines of the Gundam mythos. That said, if you are a fan of Takahashi mecha anime, especially that of Dougram, then Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans might be just what you are after.
