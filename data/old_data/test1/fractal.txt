Slime mold Brefeldia maxima growing fractally on wood In creative works Further information: Fractal art and Mathematics and art Since , more than  scientific groups have performed fractal analysis on over  of Jackson Pollock's  paintings which were created by pouring paint directly onto his horizontal canvases  Decalcomania, a technique used by artists such as Max Ernst, can produce fractal-like patterns. It involves pressing paint between two surfaces and pulling them apart.  Cyberneticist Ron Eglash has suggested that fractal geometry and mathematics are prevalent in African art, games, divination, trade, and architecture. Circular houses appear in circles of circles, rectangular houses in rectangles of rectangles, and so on. Such scaling patterns can also be found in African textiles, sculpture, and even cornrow hairstyles.  In a  interview with Michael Silverblatt, David Foster Wallace admitted that the structure of the first draft of Infinite Jest he gave to his editor Michael Pietsch was inspired by fractals, specifically the Sierpinski triangle , but that the edited novel is "more like a lopsided Sierpinsky Gasket".

Ion production capabilities If a circle boundary is drawn around the two-dimensional view of a fractal, the fractal will never cross the boundary, this is due to the scaling of each successive iteration of the fractal being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the fractal increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A fractal in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional fractal will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume.~
