A Bandai spokesperson said Gundam will come to life once more in June, at the East Higashi-Shizuoka Station, near the local Bandai factory in which there is a guided tour  that could complete your itinerary if you decide to make the trip to Shizuoka.  Originally this incredible real scale statue was erected in Tokyo's artificial island Odaiba, to commemorate the th aniversary of Mobile Suit Gundam. The statue was dismantled last September, but it was so successful  that the people from Bandai decided to bring it back to life again.
